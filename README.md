## Abstract

Quantum Computing has the ability to do computations that classical computers can not compete with. On the other hand, classical computers still have skills that can outperform quantum computers in a multitude of ways. Since both are powerful in seperate ways, utilizing a Hybrid quantum-classical Neural Network allowed both of their strengths to be harnessed. The objective of our project is to use this variety of machine learning to identify if a patient has pneumonia. This program allows error correction in real life as well as within the project, offering a second opinion to doctors as well as saving time diagnosing patients.


## How to use

A user would keep a downloaded verison of the program on their computer. To use the program, the user must install qiskit and quantuminspire, upload their file into the program, then run it. 

  
## Social Good

The importance of accurately identifying cases of pneumonia within hospitals or clinics is immense, especially in infants and elderly. Early detection of this infection can save patients from pain, abscess, and possibly death.
